## About

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

This project is divided in the following key sections:

1. Processing image data, building a pipeline to extract important facial data from source.
2. Define a Deep learning network called DCGAN and training against the train data set.
